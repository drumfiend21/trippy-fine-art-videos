# Fine Art Lyric Music Video Generator

As a musician, I wanted an easy way to make interesting music videos.

This is a simple app I created that will let you do just that.

This generator draws on art from the Metropolitan Museum of Art and creates hypnotic kaleidoscopic imagery.

All synced to your mp3 and lyrics.

Enjoy,

Mowgli Lion

Special thanks to Noel Delgado (@pixelia_me) for the incredible equalization vizualizer, and to whomever was the original author of the kaleidoscope css (see kal.js) used in this app.  If that was you, reach out!  I'll add your name.
